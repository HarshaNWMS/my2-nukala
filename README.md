## favorite vacation spot - beaches
I really love **beaches**. The big open ocean, the beautiful ***sunsets***, and the cool waves—it's all amazing. When I'm at the beach, I feel super calm and peaceful.<br>
Just watching the waves come and go is so relaxing. And you know what? I really enjoy swimming too. **There's something awesome about floating in the water and feeling weightless**. <br>
Beaches are like my happy place where I feel connected to nature and everything feels just right.
